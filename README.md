# Numeric Operations

This repository contains a Java program developed for the Mobile Development subject.

This program performs the following tasks:

- Generates and displays:

  - A vector with five integer numbers.
  - Another vector with ten integer numbers.
  - A 4x3 matrix with integer numbers.

- Calculates and displays:

  - The product of the largest element in the first vector and the smallest element in the second vector. This result is added to the elements of the matrix, creating a second resulting matrix.
  - The sum of the even elements in each row of the resulting matrix.
  - The count of elements between 1 and 5 in each column of the resulting matrix.
