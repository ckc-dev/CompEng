# Sales
A repository where the code for the second test of the subject of databases, 7th semester of computer engineering is contained.

As explained by the professor, the only thing that should be done manually is the initial data inserion. Thus, everything else, from "selling items" to querying for useful data, will be done using triggers and procedures.

## Running this project
Run the scripts in the following order:
1. `table-creation`
2. `data-insertion`
3. `procedure-definition`
4. `trigger-definition`
5. `data-insertion-procedure-calls`
6. `data-report-procedure-calls`
