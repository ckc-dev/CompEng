# 1Phone - The Sustainable Smartphone

"1Phone" is an interdisciplinary school project between the computer and manufacturing engineering courses, carried out in the second semester and aiming to idealize a product that implements the areas of both courses and follows the principles of a circular economy. 1Phone is an open-source, sustainable smartphone with a modular concept that can be easily repaired or upgraded, with the aim of reducing the amount of e-waste dumped every year.

This is the repository for the product concept website.
