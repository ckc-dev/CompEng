# Sales

A repository where the code for the second test of the subject of databases, 7th semester of computer engineering is contained.

As explained by the professor, the only thing that should be done manually is the initial data insertion. Thus, everything else, from "selling items" to querying for useful data, will be done using triggers and procedures.
