# Thesis

This repository was originally created for our ongoing TCC (Undergraduate Thesis) project. However, due to internal decisions within our institution, the project had to be abandoned. The group was split up, and each member moved on to different institutions.

As a result, each of us then had to work on completely separate, individual projects, and this one could not be used as a stating point, so it had to be scrapped. It's a shame, really.

Because of these changes, this repository will no longer be actively developed or maintained. Unfortunately, we are unable to continue with the original work as planned.

Thank you for your understanding.
